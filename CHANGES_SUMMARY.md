# PaTH Attention Integration Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Imports
- Added import for `PaTHAttention` from the pip-installed `flash-linear-attention` package
- Removed dependency on local flash-linear-attention folder

### 2. Replaced MultiHeadAttention Class
**Before:**
```python
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model: int, n_heads: int, max_seq_len: int, dropout: float = 0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.n_heads = n_heads
        self.d_k = d_model // n_heads

        self.qkv = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model * 3, bias=False)
        self.w_o = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model, bias=False)
        self.rotary = Rotary(self.d_k, max_seq_len)
        self.dropout = dropout

    def forward(self, x):
        # Standard scaled dot-product attention with rotary embeddings
        ...
```

**After:**
```python
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    """Wrapper around PaTHAttention for compatibility with existing code"""
    def __init__(self, d_model: int, n_heads: int, max_seq_len: int, dropout: float = 0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.n_heads = n_heads
        
        # Use PaTHAttention from flash-linear-attention
        self.path_attention = PaTHAttention(
            hidden_size=d_model,
            num_heads=n_heads,
            use_forget_gate=True,  # Enable forget gate for better performance
            use_qk_norm=True,      # Enable QK normalization
            use_low_rank_w=True,   # Use low-rank parameterization
            use_w_shortconv=True,  # Use short convolution
            conv_size=3,           # Convolution kernel size
            conv_bias=False        # No bias in convolution
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        # PaTHAttention expects (batch, seq_len, hidden_size) and returns (output, None, None)
        output, _, _ = self.path_attention(x)
        return output
```

### 3. Removed Rotary Class
- The `Rotary` class was removed since PaTHAttention handles position encoding internally using Householder transformations

### 4. Key Features of PaTH Attention
- **Position Encoding via Householder Transformations**: Instead of rotary embeddings, uses accumulating Householder transformations for position encoding
- **Forget Gate**: Optional gating mechanism for better sequence modeling
- **QK Normalization**: Normalizes queries and keys for training stability
- **Low-rank W Projection**: Efficient parameterization for the W matrix
- **Short Convolution**: 1D convolution for local context modeling
- **Linear Complexity**: O(n) complexity instead of O(nÂ²) for standard attention

## Benefits

1. **Linear Complexity**: PaTH attention scales linearly with sequence length, making it much more efficient for long sequences
2. **Better Position Encoding**: Householder transformations provide a more principled approach to position encoding
3. **Enhanced Features**: Forget gates and normalization improve training stability and performance
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Lower memory usage compared to standard attention, especially for long sequences

## Compatibility

- The wrapper maintains the same interface as the original `MultiHeadAttention` class
- No changes needed in `TransformerBlock` or other parts of the code
- The model can be trained with the same training loop and optimizers

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify the integration:
- `test_path_attention.py`: Tests the PaTH attention wrapper
- `test_training_integration.py`: Tests the full model with PaTH attention
- `compare_attentions.py`: Compares old vs new attention mechanisms

## Usage

The training script can now be run exactly as before:
```bash
python train_distributed_path_llm.py
```

The only difference is that it will now use PaTH attention instead of standard multi-head attention, providing better efficiency and potentially better performance on long sequences.
